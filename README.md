A tic-tac-toe game developed using JS.<br>
## Algorithm:
  <b>Minimax Algorithm</b> : Used for two player games where the algorithm finds the best move against it's opponent assuming that opponent playes optimally.
  For optimizing the minimax algorithm  <i>Alpha Beta Pruning</i>  is applied in the algorithm. <br>
  There is another way to implement computer player by using  <i>Reinforcement Learning</i> in which computer player learns playing the game by playing multiple times with itself , and learns the best move play against it's opponents .

## Features:
    - Game against Computer(Jade)
    - Selecting cahnce to play
    - Hints for best Move
    - Multiplayer(Game against )
    - Moves undo button
